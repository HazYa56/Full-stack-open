# Part2
This file contains all apps from part 2 of the course. At the countries search app I used meteomatics api to fetch data about the weather of a certain capital according to its coordinates.

## Installation
If you want to clone the project use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install node modules, run commands
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
